```
curl -sL https://downloads.lisk.io/scripts/setup_docker.Linux | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y docker-engine
```

Add the current user to a new docker group (avoids having to use sudo for each command):

sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
sudo service docker restart
```

#### 2. Log into Docker

```
docker login {username}
```

**NOTE:** If you don't have a docker account you can sign up [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

#### 3. Build the image

```
docker build -t {image_name}:{tag} -f Dockerfile --build-arg CONTEXT={local|test|main} .
```

#### 4. Push the image

```
docker push {image_name}:{tag}
```

#### 5. Run the image

```
docker run -d --restart=always \
-p {4000:4000|7000:7000|8000:8000} \
-e DATABASE_HOST=postgresql \
-e DATABASE_NAME={lisk_local|lisk_test|lisk_main} \
-e DATABASE_USER=lisk \
-e DATABASE_PASSWORD=password \
-e REDIS_ENABLED=true \
-e REDIS_HOST=redis \
-e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
-e REDIS_DB=0 \
-e FORGING_WHITELIST_IP=127.0.0.1 \
-e LOG_LEVEL=info \
--name {localnet|testnet|mainnet} \
{image_name}:{tag}
```

For more details please read: https://docs.lisk.io/docs/core-installation-docker-main

#### 7. Archive the image

```
docker save {image_name} > lisk-docker.tar
gzip -9 lisk-docker.tar.gz
```

## Using lisk-docker.sh

This script provides easy management for all the essential components used by Lisk nodes. It helps to build several containers, installation process, start|stop nodes and uninstall them.
Optionally allows launching a pgadmin container which enables management of the databases directly on the browser.

#### 1. Install environment

In order to perform a Lisk-Docker installation, the following command should be run depending on the network:

```
git clone https://github.com/liskHQ/lisk-docker
cd lisk-docker
./lisk-docker.sh install {local|test|main}
```

#### 2. Starting environment

```
./lisk-docker.sh start {local|test|main}
```

#### 3. Stopping environment

```
./lisk-docker.sh stop {local|test|main}
```

#### 4. lisk-docker.sh help

```
./lisk-docker.sh

```
# Kill all running containers.
alias dockerkillall='docker kill $(docker ps -q)'

# Delete all stopped containers.
alias dockercleanc='printf "\n>>> Deleting stopped containers\n\n" && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)'

# Delete all untagged images.
alias dockercleani='printf "\n>>> Deleting untagged images\n\n" && docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)'

# Delete all stopped containers and untagged images.
alias dockerclean='dockercleanc || true && dockercleani'
